# SBA Paycheck Protection Program Loan Level Data

In an effort to make data about the PPP more transparent, I downloaded and made available all of the CSV files released by the United States Department of Treasury Small Business Association. The original location of the data is here https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/cares-act/assistance-for-small-businesses/sba-paycheck-protection-program-loan-level-data

All of the loans greater than or equal to $150k are in a single CSV. All of the loans less than $150k are separated by state. 

You will find an example Google Colab python notebook in the notebooks tab that can load example data into Google Colab for analysis.
