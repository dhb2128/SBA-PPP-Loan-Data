# SBA Paycheck Protection Program Loan Level Data

[![contributions welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/contributions-welcome-brightgreen.svg?style=flat)](https://github.com/dwyl/esta/issues)

In an effort to make data about the PPP more transparent, I downloaded and made available all of the CSV files released by the United States Department of Treasury Small Business Association. The original location of the data is on the [US Dept of Treasury website](https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/cares-act/assistance-for-small-businesses/sba-paycheck-protection-program-loan-level-data). A note: all of the loans greater than or equal to $150k are in a single CSV. All of the loans less than $150k are separated by state. 

You will find an example Google Colab python notebook in the notebooks tab that can load example data into Google Colab for analysis. If you end up doing an analysis in colab, please submit a PR with a link to the notebook and I can add it below.
